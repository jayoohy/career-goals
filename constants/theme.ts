 * Theme tokens, ported from the Expo app's constants/theme.ts. Colors themselves live as CSS
 * custom properties in app/globals.css (so Tailwind utilities and the OS dark-mode media query
 * handle switching without a JS re-render); this file re-exports the same values for the rare
 * case a component needs a raw color (e.g. an SVG fill in PathProgressMap) rather than a class.
